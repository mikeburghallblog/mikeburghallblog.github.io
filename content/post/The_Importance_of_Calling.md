Firstly, what do I mean by 'The Importance of Calling' - this is simply the action of picking up the phone, hitting call on Slack, Teams or whatever is your flavour and speaking to people. 

This always sounds so simple and I debated whether it made a good post - but so many times have I come across chains of emails or messages trying to achieve something like resolve a technical issue or clarify a point. I always find just hitting call and speaking cuts down all the noise and resolves the issue in far less time.

So often people send an email and push the problem to someone else or delay it, but this doesn't gain anything.

When asked people often people say 'I sent an email because I needed it documented', but if you get something resolved or agreed asap, then you can capture it and document it after speaking to someone and send 'that email' as confirmation.

Try it the next time you're going to type an email and see the results for yourself!!

          &lt;p&gt;Firstly, what do I mean by &#39;The Importance of Calling&#39; - this is simply the action of picking up the phone, hitting call on Slack, Teams or whatever is your flavour and speaking to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This always sounds so simple and I debated whether it made a good post - but so many times have I come across chains of emails or messages trying to achieve something like resolve a technical issue or clarify a point. I always find just hitting call and speaking cuts down all the noise and resolves the issue in far less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often people send an email and push the problem to someone else or delay it, but this doesn&#39;t gain anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked people often people say &#39;I sent an email because I needed it documented&#39;, but if you get something resolved or agreed asap, then you can capture it and document it after speaking to someone and send &#39;that email&#39; as confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it the next time you&#39;re going to type an email and see the results for yourself!!&lt;/p&gt;
